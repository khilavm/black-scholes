First, we analyse the derivation of the BSM formula from a multi-step binomial tree. Then we look at the dynamic hedging argument of deriving the Black-Scholes differential equation."

    "<h3>Issue 1: Volatility matching</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know a priori what values $u$ and $d$ should take. They are set by a method called volatility matching, which was introduced by Cox, Ross and Rubinstein in [2]. They wanted to match the mean and variance of the stock's price obtained from the binomial tree model to that of the \"actual\" price in the limit $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. This \"actual variance\" is taken to be $\\sigma^2\\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is a small time interval and $\\sigma$ is the volatility of the price. This $\\sigma^2\\Delta t$ is the square of the standard deviation of percentage price changes when they are assumed to follow a Wiener process or Brownian motion. Them fluctuating around a **zero** mean value is the reason this quantity is also referred to as the variance of the stock price.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem here is the limit $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, where the length of time intervals becomes vanishingly small. Such a situation is clearly unrealistic and is taken only to simplify calculations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, by matching the variances between the binomial tree model and the Brownian motion process as in [1], we get $u=e^{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}}$ and $d=e^{-\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}}$. This is obtained after neglecting higher order terms in $\\Delta t$ in the Taylor series expansions of $e^{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}}$ and $e^{r \\Delta t}$. So, the validity of these values must be questioned in the real world cases of finite number of trading times and finitely large trading intervals. Later in the same text, Hull uses these equations when $\\Delta t=1$ for analysing a put option whose life is 2 years. That's hardly small!"

It has been observed the implied volatility usually exhibits a \"smile\", i.e., out-of-the-money puts trade at at higher implied volatility than out-of-the-money calls [5]. The term structure of option volatility is also never flat. Thus, when we make a 3D plot of implied volatility as a function of strike price and time, we obtain an uneven surface. The Black-Scholes model requires a flat volatility surface. </br>\n",

    "The lognormal distribution of price changes is a restrictive assumption with tractability being its chief advantage. Asset price distributions have been shown to be fat-tailed [6]. Fat-tailed distributions result in many other problems. In particular, the negligence of orders higher than $\\Delta S ^2$, which can be safely assumed for a Gaussian, cannot be taken for granted. Under expectation, we need all moments of the distribution to exist for the Black-Scholes model to work [7][8].\n",

    "<h3>Issue 4: Jumps</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The model as is doesn't take into account market discontinuities, especially jumps in security prices. Merton [9] describes a so called jump-diffusion process where the continuous time geometric Brownian motion mentioned earlier is added to a stochastic process of jumps. This process is assumed to be Poisson, i.e., jumps are taken to arrive as a Poisson process in an infinitesimally small time period. Again, the Poisson distribution has all finite moments and hence this analysis is not amenable to the existence of fat-tailed price changes."
